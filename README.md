### Description
* Using html/javascript to create a Catan board game and get familier with the basic html/javascript knowledge and learn new things!
* This project involos:
  * Basic DOM with jQuery and css styling
  * Using svg element to creat hexagon, and rendering. (Since comparing to canvas element, svg can provoide a more high resolution        geometric shape.) 
  * Math involos hexagon coordination and hexagon corners(I called it "node") numbering. This is make it possible to generate a random size hexagon map, rather than a fixed small size hexagon map. But the algorithm might need to be optimized for larger map size.
  * Implememntation of javascript class.
  * Basic arrow function implementation.

* The final goal is to make a multi-player online catan board game.
